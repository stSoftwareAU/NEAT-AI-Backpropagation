# Changelog

All notable changes to NEAT-AI-Backpropagation are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The `backpropagation` tag — used verbatim as the GRQ check-in commit subject
  — is now marked `🌀` and drops the word "Backprop":
  `🌀 · 2 accepts / 4 epochs · score: … improved by …` (issue #31).

### Added

- `gradient-check` CLI: accumulate once, sample genes, and compare each
  proposal Δ against a central finite-difference ∂MSE/∂θ — sign-agreement
  rates by gene class (issue #40). Confirms whether the aggregated learning
  direction is a descent direction before trusting full-network apply.
- `train` stamps `score`, `error`, and a run-summary `backpropagation` tag on
  `best.json` when `--scorer` is set, so GRQ workers can gate check-in on the
  full-corpus rust_scorer score without reading another program's tag
  (GRQ #3991 / #3952).
- Experimental standalone Rust trainer (`neat_ai_backpropagation`) with
  `compare`, `diff`, `train`, and `sweep` subcommands. Reverse-topo math
  stays in sibling `neat-core`; this crate ports the Lamarck config /
  apply surface and adds a trainDir-style apply-if-improved loop.
- Lamarck-identical build contract: Rust 1.95.0, unpinned `neat-core` path
  dependency gated by `neat-core.expected-version`, patch auto-increment, and
  auto-format lock sync.
- Production proof against GRQ `network.json` and the full
  `.trainData-binary_116` corpus (2,262,277 records). Rust continues
  blame through IF/MIN/MAX. A 12-gene hidden apply (11 inbound aggregate
  weights + 1 MAXIMUM bias) raised `rust_scorer` from 0.347586415202 to
  0.347614794359 (Δ +2.84e-5). Slice-only and full-net saturated applies
  overfit and are not a win (see `docs/production-win.json`).
- Train refuses re-entrant creatures (`forwardOnly: false`). Optional
  `--hidden-only`, `--accept-always`, and `sweep --skip-mse`.
